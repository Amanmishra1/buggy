1. To read words from standard input, used a queue to store it in sequence
2. Used a lock guard to avoid crash, since it is multithreaded
3. Worker thread parallely reads from queue, checks duplicate entries, maintains count, removes from queue
4. A custom sort function to sort all the words present in the vector in ascending order
5. Added searchInput function to search for a word and its count, displays success or not found
